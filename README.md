## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning system** designed to support finance teams by:
1. **Predicting expected freight cost** for vendor invoices.
2. **Flagging high-risk invoices** that require manual review due to abnormal cost, freight, or operational patterns.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

### 1. Freight Cost Prediction (Regression)
**Objective:**
Predict the expected freight cost for a vendor invoice using quantity, invoice value, and historical behavior.

**Why it matters:**
* Freight is a non-trivial component of landed cost.
* Poor freight estimation impacts margin analysis and budgeting.
* Early prediction improves procurement planning and vendor negotiation.

### 2. Invoice Risk Flagging (Classification)
**Objective:**
Predict whether a vendor invoice should be flagged for manual approval due to abnormal cost, freight, or delivery patterns.

**Why it matters:**
* Manual invoice review does not scale.
* Financial leakage often occurs in large or complex invoices.
* Early risk detection improves audit efficiency and operational control.

## 📂 Data Sources
Data is stored in a relational SQLite database (`inventory.db`) with the following tables:
* `vendor_invoice` – Invoice-level financial and timing data
* `purchases` – Item-level purchase details
* `purchase_prices` – Reference purchase prices
* `begin_inventory`, `end_inventory` – Inventory snapshots

SQL aggregation is used to generate **invoice-level features**.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA focuses on **business-driven questions**, such as:
* Do flagged invoices have higher financial exposure?
* Does freight scale linearly with quantity?
* Does freight cost depend on quantity?

Statistical tests (t-tests) are used to confirm that flagged invoices differ meaningfully from normal invoices.

## 🤖 Models Used

### Regression (Freight Prediction)
* Linear Regression (baseline)
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor (final model)

### Classification (Invoice Flagging)
* Logistic Regression (baseline)
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier (final model with GridSearchCV)

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using **GridSearchCV with F1-score** to handle class imbalance.
